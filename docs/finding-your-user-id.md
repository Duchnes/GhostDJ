This page describes how to find your unique User ID. Any of these methods work, and you only need to do one of them.

## Method 1
1. Enter text as if you are going to mention (ping) yourself. (Make sure that you are mentioning yourself and no one else)<br>![Mention](/assets/images/mention.png)
2. Insert a backslash (`\`) before the mention<br>![Backslash](/assets/images/backslash.png)
3. Send the message. What will appear is your ID surrounded by `<@` or `<@!` on the left and `>` on the right (the message should be highlighted)<br>![ID](/assets/images/message-id.png)
4. Copy _only_ the numbers; the other symbols are not part of your User ID<br>![Copy](/assets/images/id-copy.png)
